## Log lifecycle events

The complete list of lifecycle events can be found in the [Gatsby Node API docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/config-files/gatsby-node/).

The quickest way to figure out the order of events is to write a loop that logs for each event. See the example [gatsby-node.js](gatsby-node.js) file.
